# ClassMedian

**The task was as follows:**

*Create a Java program (classMedian). In the main method, three integers a, b and c are to be read in. Then determine the middle of these values and output it as "median" of the three values.*

*Note: The median is not the arithmetic mean of the three numbers! Think of a, b and c in order of magnitude. The program outputs the value which is then in the middle.*
